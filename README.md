# CapsNet-Adversarial

I show that reconstruction error can be used to detect adversarial attacks against encoder-decoder network architectures. These attacks are carried out in a white-box scenario for the classification+encoder network (in this case a capsule network), and black-box for the decoder network. This method can detect ~70% of adversarial attacks at a 5% false positive rate. Check out [Attack-CapsNet.ipynb](https://github.com/KellerJordan/CapsNet-Adversarial/blob/master/Attack-CapsNet.ipynb) for implementation details and results.
